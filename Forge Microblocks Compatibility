Greetings, Team CoFH!

I am sure you have probably gotten requests regarding this topic before, but I figured I would leave a suggestion anyway incase.

I would really like to see compatibility with Forge Microblocks and Thermal Expansion pipelines working again. I am guessing its
due to the 4.0 update that this no longer works. While there are obviously work-arounds with other mod pipes, I have always
preferred your pipelines. This is mainly for using the donut-hole covers in Microblocks so that we can have pipes in our walls.

Thanks again,
